				<h3>The 500 bedded, BANGABANDHU HEALTH CARE was built with a view to ensure proper health care services to the habitants of the northern part of greater Dhaka, especially the distressed poor community. </br></br>
				Presently the hospital is functioning full swing with only 40% of approved manpower including indoor, outdoor, surgery, pathology, radiology, dialysis and burn unit etc. Due to paucity of manpower, budget and other logistics, some departments, like Blood bank, ICU, CCU, Neuro-medicine, Nero-Surgery, Psychiatry, physical medicine etc. are yet to begin. </br></br>
				Hospital is now vibrant with almost 21-2500 outdoor patients and 300-350 indoor patients daily. It was revealed in last MIS conference in DGHS that this hospital faced second highest outdoor patients turnout among all the hospitals in country. 
				</br></br>
				It is reducing the patient-load of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Suhruwardi Medical College Hospital, NITOR & other hospitals around the city. </br></br>
				Since its journey began, it has proved its uniqueness by serving humanity and working towards only proposed green hospital in public sector. </h3>
